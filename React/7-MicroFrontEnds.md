# Micro Frontends

## 1. What are Micro Frontends?

Micro frontends are an architectural style where a single web application is divided into multiple smaller, independently deployable units, each responsible for a specific feature or section of the user interface. Each micro frontend is developed, deployed, and maintained independently, allowing teams to work on different parts of the application simultaneously without significant interdependencies.

**Key characteristics:**

- **Independence:** Each micro frontend operates independently and can be developed and deployed separately.
- **Isolation:** They are loosely coupled but can interact through well-defined interfaces.
- **Autonomy:** Teams can choose different technologies or frameworks for different micro frontends, aligning with their specific needs.

## 2. Why Use Micro Frontends?

Micro frontends offer several benefits:

- **Scalability:** Teams can work on different parts of the application concurrently, speeding up development and allowing for easier scaling.
- **Independence:** Teams can develop, test, and deploy features independently, reducing the risk of affecting other parts of the application.
- **Flexibility:** Different micro frontends can use different technologies or frameworks, allowing teams to choose the best tool for each specific task.
- **Maintenance:** Easier to maintain and update smaller, isolated components rather than a large, monolithic application.
- **Reduced Time-to-Market:** Faster development and deployment cycles due to the independent nature of micro frontends.

## 3. Can You Describe the Key Principles of Micro Frontends?

Key principles of micro frontends include:

- **Decomposition by Business Capability:** Divide the application based on business functionalities or domains rather than technical layers.
- **Independence:** Each micro frontend should be independently deployable, meaning that changes to one micro frontend should not necessitate changes to others.
- **Technology Agnosticism:** Different micro frontends can use different technologies or frameworks, depending on the requirements of the functionality they implement.
- **Separation of Concerns:** Each micro frontend should handle a specific concern or feature of the application, promoting modularity.
- **Autonomy:** Teams have full control over their micro frontendâ€™s lifecycle, including development, testing, and deployment.

## 4. How Do You Structure a Micro Frontend Architecture?

Structuring a micro frontend architecture involves:

- **Defining Micro Frontend Boundaries:**
  - Identify and define clear boundaries based on business domains or functional areas (e.g., user profile, shopping cart).

- **Shell Application:**
  - Develop a shell application (or container) that serves as the host for integrating various micro frontends. It manages routing, layout, and high-level application concerns.

- **Micro Frontend Development:**
  - Each micro frontend is developed independently with its own codebase, build processes, and deployment pipelines.

- **Integration Layer:**
  - Use integration mechanisms to embed micro frontends into the shell application, such as iframes, web components, or JavaScript module federation.

- **Routing and Navigation:**
  - Implement a routing strategy that ensures smooth navigation between different micro frontends while maintaining a cohesive user experience.

- **Shared Resources:**
  - Manage shared resources like styles, libraries, and global state to ensure consistency and avoid duplication.

## 5. What Are the Common Approaches to Integrating Micro Frontends into a Single Application?

Common approaches to integrating micro frontends include:

- **iFrames:**
  - Embedding micro frontends in iframes is a straightforward approach that provides strong isolation but may have limitations in terms of communication and performance.
